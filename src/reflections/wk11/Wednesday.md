Daily Journal

So, today we build up an app in class called groupme. It has been a good refresher to go over things. After lunch, today we had some career homework to practice white board challenges with fellow classmates. I ended up doing some and helping watch a few other people. I learned a lot from that. My logic has gotten rusty. I definitely need to do some logic challenges online. Also, I have learned that pseudo coding is valuable during these challenges. After that, Jake just happened to be near by and showed us a few things about the whiteboard challenge and how he would do things and then we kind of turned it into an ask me anything session. There was some good information coming from him.
