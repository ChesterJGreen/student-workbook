Daily Journal

Today in lecture we spent all day building a full-stack app. Restaurant Reviewer. This was a great review day. I'm really glad we had the chance to go over a full-stack app completely in class. Although, after starting my final I'm realizing that there are just some issues that always need to be troubleshooted and no 2 projects are exactly the same. 

Over the course of this cohort, I have learned a lot of things. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of all the names of the things we have learned to use. I got the major ones though. We know javascript, HTML, CSS, C#, SQL, Node.js, and Vue. 

 I am writing this after receiving my final, but still on the first weekend. I have budgeted some time to work on my final this weekend. Sadly, I probably spent a little over half the time that I had mentally prepared to use over the weekend. I still think I'm in decent shape. I guess we'll see by the end of the week. 

 It is pretty exciting to be to the end of this course. It is a little sad, I was really starting to enjoy my classmates, and the faculty. There are a few people that it took me until a few weeks ago to start getting to know better. 

 I am super pumped to be going into a field of work that I am going to enjoy. I was in pest control for 8 years. It wasn't bad, but I always knew that my potential was being wasted. Especially since that past year I maxed out my pay-scale. It is comforting to know that I can more than likely start my pay-scale in this field more than what I left pest control at. 

 I would have to say that I have really enjoyed the ability to build something everyday in this course. Some projects were more elaborate than others, but I was still building something everyday. I took great pleasure in being able to build a portfolio of work that I can share with other people. When people ask me how things are going, I can point to my apps. That is a super fun thing to do. I am so excited and grateful for the opportunity I had to go through this course and to to be able to change industries.
