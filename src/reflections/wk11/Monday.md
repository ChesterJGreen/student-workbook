1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
- it allows one derived class to inherit from the base class. inheriting means that it shares code.
2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
- Yes. a class will inherit all members of the base class unless there is a private member        
3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
- visibility affects inheritance. private members have special rules that allow them to be visible only if they are nested in the parent class while. protected members are only visible in child classes. public members are accessible and are interfaces of the child class.
