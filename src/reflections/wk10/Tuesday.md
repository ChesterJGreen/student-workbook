Day 2 of C#. 

So, today we learned C# with more of a template. We're not using the program.cs file anymore. We are creating a service file, a model file, and using a controller file. Things are looking very similar to how we used vue and node. Today we worked on making the back end for Greg's list one final time with C#. Here is a link to the back end with c#.

Questions:

Read Foundations of C# > C# List and answer the following questions

1. What is a List in C#?
- generic type that appears to function much like an array in javascript
2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
- List.Add, List.AddRange, List.Clear, List.Find. I might use them often because these were the most commonly used functions I used with arrays in javascript
3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
- List.Find
