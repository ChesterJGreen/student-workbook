Today we learned how to add Auth0 to our dotnet projects. It wasn't terribly difficult. We also learned how to populate creator information on our get methods connected to our sql tables. We also did some partner programming. I partnered up with Jaron and we worked on the allspice project. Here is a link to the github since it is a backend project.

Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
- Enums are lists of strongly typed constants with members that are symbolic names, corresponding to an underlying integral type. 
2. How can you modify an Enum?
- with the:* * syntax following the enum identifier
3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
- When we were using enums in node.js we would use them to establish specific strings that could be used. So, if we wanted a day of the week, enums allowed us to tell the user that we will only accept monday, tuesday, wed.., etc... as a value and no other strings.
