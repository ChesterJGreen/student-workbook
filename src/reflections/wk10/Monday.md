So, we are starting C#. It doesn't seem horribly different than javascript. I am noticing that it is very particular. You have to make sure the syntax is perfect or it won't even run the program. It seems like in javascript you can sometimes get things to work even if they aren't perfectly established. However, I do like that everything is functioning before the program will ever run. We made rock, paper, scissors. I was trying to make it more complicated than it needs to be, but got a little lost. I just kept the code simple with no additional files.

Questions:

Read Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
- Value type - holds a data value within its own memory space, Reference type - store the address where the value is being stored, Pointer type - do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
- bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. A lot of these datatypes are familiar from javascript
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
- Reference types store the location of value in the reference. Value types directly store the value in the local storage.
