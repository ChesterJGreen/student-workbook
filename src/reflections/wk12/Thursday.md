Daily Journal

Today has been eventful. These deadlines aren't bad, I actually like them. They help me to maximize to work efforts. However, sometimes you hit a snag... and then doubt starts settling in. Eventually, I figure out how to solve the issue. Then, I complete tasks effortlessly and I'm almost puzzled at how I'm this good. It's a back and forth, up and down emotional ride. I have to say at the end of it all, I love the results and look back on the whole experience fondly. I have finally completed my final project at midnight. I am ready to turn it in and see if i pass. I'm excited and nervous to know that class is coming to an end and we get to go out and build Apps for a living. 

I had a mock interview today with Brittany. She is really good at what she does. She really knows her stuff. I tried my best to give a decent interview, but I have been so focused on my final that I barely had any time to prepare. She takes really good notes though and I received some really good feedback. She seems like she could really run right over a person if they ticked her off. I feel fortunate that she is an advocate for me and that she really wants me to succeed in getting a good job.
