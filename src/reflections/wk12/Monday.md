Daily Journal

Coming in to school today I had one goal. I was planning on finishing my back end by the end of the day. I had built most of the backend over the weekend, but knew that I was going to have issues with the many to many relationship. The vaultKeeps were an obstacle for me. I had over 80 tests passed and knew that the majority would be solved if I could fix my vaultKeeps. It took me all morning to solve that issue. I did hit a mental wall where I started doubting if I could reach my goal. I did get help from some TA's, and they were awesome. Luckily, by 1:00PM I finally solved the issues with a few pointers on where to find reference. I went to lunch with a feeling of peace. The stress just fell off me. When I came back from lunch break, I still had about 8 tests to fix. I started at the top and worked my way down. At times, when things were tough I would focus on a test that seemed a bit more like low hanging fruit. By the end of the day, I had completed all but 1 test. Later that night I finished the final test. And enjoyed the joy of accomplishment as I ran the tests a final time to see that every test had passed properly. 

Some takeaways that I had from today. The elvis operator is very useful when you don't need to authorize the user to be logged in to do something, but you want to check what the logged in users info is to compare to the creatorId or other important uses. 

I'm looking forward to doing the front end work. The masonry I have looked at some documentation on how to do, but it is going to take some effort.
