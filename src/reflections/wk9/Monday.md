This has been a great group to work with. It was nice to have a chill weekend for once, but I know that I am going to do what it takes to get this group project completed. Today, we ended up working in 2 groups of 2 and John had a floater position. Sherene and I worked on the posts/comments while Shanker and Jaron worked on the plants/garden sections. While we were creating front end functions we found that some of our backend REST Api functions were not 100% accurate like we had thought they were.

Questions

Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
- We have been using scrum and agile principles to do a standup and discuss what we accomplished the previous day and what we will be assigned to working on the next day.
2. What went well so far?
- Everybody has been great team players. We all have had a chance to rotate working with different people and work on different parts.
3. What would you do differently? Why?
- I think that I would have liked to have planned better for our standup meetings everyday. I was nominated to be the SCRUM master and I kind of showed up not knowing what to say or do like everyone else, but I felt the pressure of making sure I assigned a direction to our group.
