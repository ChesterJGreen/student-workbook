Today was great, we were able to focus on random things. We stopped working in pairs because all the little issues we were having were small and spread out across the whole app. In retrospect, I think we might have moved more quickly across these issues if we had continued to partner program. But, it appears that we are almost finished with most of the project.

1. What is an SSL certificate?
- Secure Sockets Layer - SSL certificates are a small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remain private.
2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
- ~Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate
This certificate shows the padlock, HTTPS, business name, and business country in the address bar to diminish being mistaken for a spam website. 
~Organization Validated (OV SSL) Certificate
This certificate verifies that your organization and domain validation are real. Organization Validated (OV) SSL certificates offer a medium level of encryption and are obtained in two steps. First, the CA would verify who owns the domain and if the organization is operating legally.
~ Domain Validation (DV) Certificate
The Domain Validation (DV) certificate offers a low level of encryption shown as a green padlock next to the URL in the address bar. This is the quickest validation you can receive, and you'll only need a few company documents to apply.
~ Wildcard SSL Certificates
Wildcard SSL Certificates are in the "domain and subdomain number" category. Wildcard SSLs ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use that same certificate for subdomains.
~ Unified Communications (UCC) SSL Certificate
Also known as Multi-domain SSL certificates, Unified Communications certificates (UCCs) allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. UCCs were created to bridge communication between a single server and browser but have since expanded to include multiple domain names by the same owner.
~ Single Domain SSL Certificate
A Single Domain SSL protects one domain. The thing to remember about this certificate is that you can't use it to protect subdomains or a completely different domain.
3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
- when websites are equivalently ranked by google the encryption will give a slight boost. Customers can have more confidence when they see your website is secure.
