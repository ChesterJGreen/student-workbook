The Checkpoint that we had over the weekend was a little stressful. Saturday I started realizing that the project was going to talk a while. Half-way through sunday i started panicking. However, I wasn't sure if we had time to work on it monday. Lucky for me, I was able to work on my project monday and that's when everything came together. It felt great to know that I still had 12 hours before it was due. I just took my time styling it. It was very enjoyable at that point. I have to admit, when I overcome challenges in my code it feels amazing. After I passed, my group for working on our capstone just sort of fell into place. We decided to do a gardening app. Something that could be social and helpful with gardening.

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
- A showcase for the work you have done. An example of your projects and things you have developed. Great for showing a potential employer what is in store if they hire you. 
2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective? 
- Being sure to show off multiple projects and really get them down well. Also, if you make something close to what the company is already producing, it shows your attention to detail and how you can add to the current team's value. 

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
- Some of my later work is definitely more polished and functionally written much smoother. I would include my buglog, social network, fix my sprintr and show it off as well. These works look great, and the functionality is more complex than earlier projects.
