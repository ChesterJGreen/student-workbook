This group work is taking longer than i had anticipated that i thought it would take to get going. We got about maybe half of the back end work done today. I thought we would have the whole thing done for sure. But, we are making sure to test the code and are making sure that we are getting it right. 

Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
- Unit Testing, Component Testing, End-To-End (E2E) Testing. unit testing provides developers with confidence in their code. 
Component testing provides a way to test components, they must be mounted to the DOM (either virtual or real) in order to fully assert that they are working. End to End testing provides validation on all of the layers in your application.
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
- Probably the end to end testing because the it focuses on the user experience and will probably make you go through all the testing to make sure the user experience functions properly. 
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
- I would probably say that unit testing is the least important. I would more be interested in saying that they are all important but if I had to choose I would say that unit testing is the least important. I believe this because the entire experience can be more important to the user than 1 single instance of something on a page. But, if every little thing keeps breaking that would limit the users experience and you would have to utilize unit testing anyways.
