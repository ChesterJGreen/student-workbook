# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
asynchronous code means that some of the functions will not complete at the same time and therefore need to have a callback when they are finished. synchronous code means that it will run smoothly from top to bottom.

**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Open-Closed Principle: code should be open for extension but closed for modification
```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

a convention where functions that use callbacks take some time to produce a result. meaning you need the function to get attention after its task is completed
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

**6.** Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

```
**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Application Programming Interface
```
**8.** In the `MVC` design pattern, who is responsible for making calls to `APIs`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the controller
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
it keeps code organized and cleaner
```
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

```
**11.** What is a 500 error?
