I really enjoyed the spellbook lecture in class. We learned how to get from an api, post to an api, delete from an api and I'm not sure that we updated the api, but we definitely had a fun time learning. I learned that it is better to take notes on the order of how to do theses methods so that you can verify through the console or on the webpage that things are working properly. Before I was just taking notes as i saw fit and then realizing later that I didn't know the order and just had to hope i copied/translated the code perfectly to fit the project I was working on. I'm glad I discovered that writing api is about the order rather than the just doing the code.

Read Asynchronous Code > Async and Await and answer the following questions
1. What is the purpose of Async/Await?
- when you async/await you know that the tasks you are assigning won't be completed instantly and you need the code to recognize that when the async part is finished it need to go back and notify the service to grab that info to complete the method
2. What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function? 
-you have to use the try/catch method. so you are telling it to try and if it doesn't come back in the alotted time to just send a failed message so that the programmer can figure out why.
3. What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
- debugging is easier, sometimes processes across the internet take more time and need time to complete processes
