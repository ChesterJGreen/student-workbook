Today in class we learned how to make a Jeopardy game. That was very interesting. This was another great example of how to pull from an API. Also, it showed us how to store information on a different API. Probably the coolest part for me was when Jake showed us how to hover over the question and to have the answer slowly fade into view to display the answer. That day we worked on an itunes api that would allow us to search for music and get multiple results. We could then listen to a short clip of the music and then save the songs we liked to our own playlist saved on the sandbox api. Here is the link to the [itunes api project](https://chesterjgreen.github.io/Music-Is-Fun/)
