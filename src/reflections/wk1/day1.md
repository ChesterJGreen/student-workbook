# Day 1


What I learned in coding school is .....
Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > GIT 101 and answer the following questions

Today was highly focused on going through all policies and expecations. The staff did a good job of communicating high expecatations and fostering a never quit attitude is necessary. It was nice to get some in person training toward the end of the day. I had a few issues during my online pre-course work that had me concerned, but were cleared up relatively quickly after being instructed properly and being able to ask questions. 

## In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use git because it is a valuable resource to share the same project among multiple computers and allows programmers to save work on the local computer which gives the ability to push code up to the main project and pull code changes down to each individual computer. Also, the manager of the project can revert back to an older version if needed since the entire project is saved frequently. 

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

By having multiple branches you can test out some code to see if the main branch should go in that direction. If the test code works out you can merge the branches to make them the new Master Branch. This provides an environment where experimenting with better and more efficient coding can be tested and implemented. 

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub

I believe that Git is the resource available to a computer and its network. However, Github is more like a social platform designed to share code among coders. In our specific situation, it will be used to showcase code we will use in certain projects to prove our abilities.
