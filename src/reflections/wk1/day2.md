# Day 2 
## Daily Journal

Learning today focused on CSS. It is necessary to figure out how to divide up a web page in html. After it is divided up properly you can begin to use CSS to make things line up better and to look better. It seems like you can spend a lot of time messing around with the different functionalities of any selector, property, and/or value. We started by going over a simple resume with different sections, headings, and alignments. After Lunch, we came back and worked on building a sample website that looks very similar to the website i created.

### **Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > CSS and answer the following questions**

### What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
- A pseudo-class is one that doesn't exist until you creat it through CSS. They appear when something has happened, typically. A popular pseudo-class is :hover. When your mouse cursor hovers over a button it will change color. It seems that some other ones that may be common to use might be:<p>
:before, :after, :hover, :visited
### What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
- Specificity is what helps determine the end result of a rule placed on an element after multiple rules may have been targeting it. The value which is targeting the element with the highest specificity claims the element and will display it accordingly. Different selectors notify CSS how much of a priority to place on a rule targeting the element.
### What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
- I think that you would end up with code not working properly if you have too many !important features. Also, you will have a difficult time figuring out which one is producing the negative outcome since they will be hard to distinguish.
