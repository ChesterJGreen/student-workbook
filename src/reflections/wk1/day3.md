# Day 3
## Journal
- Today we spent learning about bootstrap. It seems like a very useful tool to help with CSS and all the designing process. New keywords are helping me to navigate more area than when I was just using CSS. I spent a long time working on a clone website. The end result looked good to me except I struggled with spacing.
- completed bootstrap challenges 1-3 on Udemy

### Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
- The box shadowing on items is my favorite tip. I think that will come in handy with many different designs
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
- Good design can help people decide to stay longer or leave quicker on a website. Design can influence whether someone feels like the website is a safe place to purchase items or that it looks kinda shady and I won't give them my debit information. By making a website look more professional you can sway the emotions and thougts of a person visiting. Through design alone you can convey just about any thing you want. Design is art and as such can influence many aspects of a person's feelings and thoughts while they view a web page.
