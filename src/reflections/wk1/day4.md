# Day 4
## Journal
- Today we spent lecture time working on designing your web page before ever writing a word of code. Using Figma is a great way to actually visually see what you want to happen before you get to work. Our morning exercise was using the different flex properties to get your frog on the correct lillypad. In the afternoon, we worked in pairs and took turns being the navigator and the driver while we worked on cloning a web page Denofgeek.com. The assignment took a while and so we had to fork the repository and each worked on the remainder at home. My completed version is at [The Den of Superheroes](https://chesterjgreen.github.io/Den-of-codeworks-Superhero/)
