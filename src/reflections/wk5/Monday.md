Today we learned about Node. The structure of the code holds the same but some of the details about how to use things changes a bit. Not completely, but enough to have to make sure you learn the new code. The CRUD principles remain the same. Also, the is the first time we have set up our own server which uses localhost 3000 rather than the localhost 8080 like we used to. Here is a link to the project we did called [BurgerShak](https://chesterjgreen.github.io/burgerShak/) It's all server work, so I don't think it will show much in the web browser. So, here's a link to the [respository](https://github.com/ChesterJGreen/burgerShak)

Read Servers with Node/Express > Using Query Parameters and answer the following questions
1. What is the purpose of a Query String?
- A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or “appending,” that information to the end of a URL.
2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
- a query begins with a ? and the parameter is assigned a value, if you add another parameter you add the & symbol and add that parameter. 
3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
- When you need a tiny amount of input for objects, if it is included in the query, it could be accessed a lot quicker and easier.
