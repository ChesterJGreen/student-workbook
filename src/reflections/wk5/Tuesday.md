Today we learned how to start our own server with MongoDb. We had to set up our own server. We then went in and created a server side for our Greg's list web page. It was very interesting. The programming for the server side had a lot of code that was already set up and we are going to look into very few of those documents.

The code is very similar to when we set up our client side software to connect with apis.
