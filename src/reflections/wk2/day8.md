# Day 8 
### Journal 

 Today we learned more of a practical approach at javascript. We learned how to use javascript to provide more functionality to a webpage. By using the response from the User of a webpage you can take that information and display a completely different webpage depending on the input and output available. As a class we watched Mark put together a web page where the user could select a different button and the page would display a different animal and would show text explaining the noise that animal would make. In the afternoon we started designing our own web page with buttons and made a rock, paper, scissors game. [MY ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME](https://chesterjgreen.github.io/rockpaperscissors/)
