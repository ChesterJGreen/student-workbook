# Day 6
## Journal
We just turned in our first checkpoint this morning. That was a good experience. Although, I felt like I met all the requirements I was slightly worried about turning in my project. However, I did feel a sense of genuine concern that we simply tried rather than our efforts being forced to be perfect. I experienced a sense of relief and encouragement to know that as long as we try we should do just fine. That being said, moving into Javascript area has been a little difficult. My mind has felt a bit numb trying to pick up the different syntax styles and such. My mind eventually made the transition back into javascript jargon.

## What is Scope ?
- scope is the different levels of a document. The scope can be general in the sense of the entire document. Or scope can be more fine tuned to focus on the area of code block. 

## What is Hoisting ?
- Hoisting is where the code invisbly makes a line of code standout because there is something to happen with that line of code when a more fine tuned reading comes back through. Hoisting is where the code may be recognized that it has made a declaration, but maybe didn't remember what has been defined until the code is more fully written.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
- I would use let inside a code block or in most cases generally.
- I would use var outside of code block and in cases where I may want to use the variable more generally.
- I would use const in situations where I would not want to have the ability to change the value stored in a variable. Things that may be more permanent like physically permanent attributes on a person.
