# Day 7
This second day of javascript problems was very savage. I ended up doing fine on the loops questions. I still needed a little bit of help to get the answers squared away correctly, but the arrays were an accumulation of the loops and arrays and almost every other problem we dealt with so far. It was a good section to add up all the processes we've learned so far. I definitely struggled with that section. Here is my attempt. [Day 2 of Javascript problems](https://chesterjgreen.github.io/js-tests-loops-and-arrays/). I am pretty excited to start writing functionality for apps and webpages. I've recently seen a few games and websites that the TAs have designed and it seems pretty cool.

## Read Intro to JS > JavaScript Functions and answer the following questions

---
## 1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
- function funcName(parameter) {code}
- let funcName = function(parameter){code}
- let funcName = (parameter) => {code}
## 2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
- parameters are banana words or placeholders. arguments are the name of the array or object being plugged into the function
## 3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
- When a function provides or uses another function it is a higher order function
ex - array.prototype.map
