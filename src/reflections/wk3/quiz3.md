# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
property = staff.name
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the bundling of data and the methods that act on that data
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single-Responsibility
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
a Class is like a reference and an instance is an exact situation of that reference. class is like a chair. instance of a class is like a lazy-boy recliner sitting in my parents living room. 
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
an instance of an object where its form is taken from a class model and usually defined by the user.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
it helps with encapsulation and keeps responsibilities simple. the view is controlled by html.  
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The controller takes requests from the view and also sends visual changes to the view. Also it requests information or changes from the model/service.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The service is what calculates methods and functions to modify values by taking in the model/state information and sending results back to the controller
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The model is just a reference. It holds information of how any instance should look or what information it should hold. 
```
