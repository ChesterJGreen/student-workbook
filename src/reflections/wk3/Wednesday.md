Wow, so I was really intrigued by the morning challenge. That was actually fun to me to learn how to detect a palindrome. Even more interesting was seeing the different ways to improve the code. I now understand that more code is okay as long as the iterations are fewer. We worked on lessening the iterations to 1 and then we even reduced it to half of an iteration. That was really interesting. In the afternoon we worked on Gregslist webpage. The focus was to make it so that our controller would draw the cards and that the form that allowed new input would update and add more cards automatically. Mark showed us how to do the first car section and then we had to re-write the code to add the houses and jobs listings. It is definitely fun to see the code written appear successfully on the screen. Here is the link to my version [Gregslist](https://chesterjgreen.github.io/gregslist-mvc/) At the whiteboard meeting after class, we went over some difficult problems. I'm thinking that I need to study them more.
