Today's review had a few new items. Things that we needed to learn though. We learned about SASS which its acronym is pretty funny. Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. It seems like a pretty easy way to edit your bootstrap templates and add in other items without having to use css. We watched Mark construct a pizza ordering website with the options to create and remove the different concoctions. At the end, he showed us how to use local storage to save and load. It seems pretty simple. During partner lab time I was partnered with Tom. I am grateful that I got to work with him. I could see that he really understands HOW this new code works and was able to implement it well. I on the other hand am memorizing  how to use the code and the how seems to come later, usually a few days down the road. Here is a link to our store called [cj's store](https://chesterjgreen.github.io/cjs-store/)
